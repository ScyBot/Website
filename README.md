Final Project for Webware by Sebastian Salvo
. Massachusetts tourism site

 I designed this website to be used as a tourism site for people wanting to visit Massachusetts. 
 There were a few issues I ran into when designing the website. There was an event listener that 
 would mark the description box in the website as not hidden, as it started out as hidden. The 
 original intent was whenever someone clicked on a section of Massachusetts, a tool-tip styled 
 box would appear giving the user information about the history behind their selection. The other 
 side I wished I could fix is the search functioning. I set it up so the user could search for a 
 specific county in Massachusetts and those names would display. I wanted it so if the user 
 searched, for example, food, there could be a separate page devoted to telling the places to go
 where the user can get the best food. Other than that, the site came out to be much more 
 political than I had intended.
